# Counter Strike: Global Offensive Competitive Matchmaking Data
By: Daniel Weiland

## Introduction
For this project I analyzed data from ESEA matches, from both pick up games and team scrimmages.  The data from my analysis was sourced from 
Kaggle.com, and was collected during a two week period in August of 2018.  While the game has had many rebalancing changes since then, I believe many 
of the insights from this analysis remain highly relevant.
